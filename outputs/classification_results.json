While the Boston Tea Party is a factual historical event, the presence of a black individual in this context is historically improbable, as the event predominantly involved white colonists. This creates an anachronism or an unlikely scenario, leading to the classification of the content as D. The overall setting and actions suggest a reenactment of a significant historical event, but the demographics presented do not align with the known historical context, making it necessary to classify it as potentially non-factual.",
    "black_pope.png": "D\n\nThe image depicts an individual of African descent dressed in traditional papal attire, which is historically improbable as there has never been a pope of African descent in the history of the Roman Catholic Church.

Therefore, it falls under classification D, as it relates to humans and may be content that is not factual.",
